# SuiteletComponents
Generic Components for Netsuite Suitelets that are made out of pure HTML, Javascript, and CSS. To give a sense of what I mean, the first component made for this was a RecordsTable. The RecordsTable class builds a raw HTML table through Javascript, you hand it the div that will hold it and the data that you got from your query and it will go and make all the table rows, etc.
